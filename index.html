        The Hulk, one of Marvel's most iconic superheroes, is the alter ego of Dr. Bruce Banner, a brilliant but
        socially withdrawn scientist. His story is one of tragedy, rage, and inner conflict as he struggles to control
        the monster within. The Incredible hulk was created by
        <a title="el mismo que hizo spiderman así es" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee">Stan Lee</a>
        and

    <h3>Story</h3>

    <p id="story">
        Bruce Banner was a genius scientist specializing in gamma radiation. While working on a Gamma Bomb (G-Bomb) for
        the U.S. military, he discovered a young boy, Rick Jones, had wandered onto the testing site. Without thinking,
        Banner rushed in to save him, absorbing an enormous amount of gamma radiation when the bomb exploded.
        <br><br>
        Instead of killing him, the radiation triggered a mutation in his DNA. From that moment on, whenever Banner
        experienced extreme anger or stress, he transformed into The Hulk, a massive green-skinned creature of
        unstoppable strength and pure rage.

        In Marvel Comics, Hulk is the monstrous alter ego of Dr. Bruce Banner, a scientist who transforms into a
        green-skinned powerhouse
        whenever he gets angry. First appearing in The Incredible Hulk #1 (1962), Hulk embodies raw strength and
        uncontrollable rage, often struggling between his humanity and his destructive nature.
        Over the years, he has been both a hero and a menace, battling powerful foes and even the Avengers.

    <p>
        In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Hulk is portrayed as a complex character balancing brute force with
        intelligence.
        Played by Edward Norton in The Incredible Hulk (2008) and later by Mark Ruffalo, this version of Hulk evolves
        from a raging
        beast to a more controlled and even humorous character. By Avengers: Endgame (2019), he merges with
        Bruce Banner’s intellect, becoming "Professor Hulk," a more balanced and self-aware version of the hero.
